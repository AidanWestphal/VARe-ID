thresholds:
  t_seconds: 20 # Minimum time gap (in seconds) between selected annotations
  frames_per_subsequence: 2 # Number of frames per subsequence
  frame_interval: 8 # Number of frames per second (used to convert t_seconds to frame gap)
  threshold_percentage_stage2: 0.1 # Stage 2: Use 90% of the highest CA score per tracking ID as the threshold

settings:
  use_ca_score: true # Use CA score for filtering IF available
  use_viewpoint: true # Use viewpoint for filtering IF available
